# Lightweight-Cryptography
## Overview
The LCM (Lightweigth Cryptography Module) is a software component proposed to improve network performance through the implementation of a Cryptographic Scheme with Cryptography and Intrusion Detection functionalities.
The LCM is actually  built for a specific [Comp4Drones](https://www.comp4drones.eu) Reactive Security case study.
## How it works
The  component offers its security features for communications between different entities by encrypting and decrypting the data that is be exchanged between them.
Moreover, when an encrypted data is received, the component verifies the authenticity of the message.
